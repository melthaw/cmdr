Some of us know the regular commands and flags , and can get normal task done , but have to google how to do when the case gets complicated.
The `cmdr` is a cli tool to help us get complicated cli tasks done quickly.

* Supply classic command and flag combination to face one case.
* And show the original command , just copy it and modify the args to match your case.
